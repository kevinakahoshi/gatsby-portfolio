# Welcome to my revamped portfolio repo 👋🏻

My live portfolio is currently built using React.js and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance
however I wanted to give a headless CMS a shot, so I am rebuilding it using JAM stack!

## Technologies

- Gatsby.js
- React Context
- Styled Components
- Sanity Studio

## Project Status

This is still a work in progress for me, so there is no live previewable link right
now, however I'm hoping to have something up and running soon.  Stay tuned for more
updates!
